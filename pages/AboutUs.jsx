                collaborating and communicating, engaging,
                and scaling rapidly. All while being totally
                transparent and working the way we want.</p>

                <p className="paragraph-2">As we integrated and
                automated, built workflows, created templates,
                and expanded our community beyond our wildest
                expectations, we continued to grow.
                It is through this journey that the MissBooks
                Work OS was born.</p>

                    June 10th, 2021 marked the start of a new era
                    for MissBooks we rang the opening bell and
                    officially became a publicly traded company
                    on Nasdaq.<br/><br/> These days, we continue to fuel our
                    growth by evolving into a multi-product
                    company, providing people, teams, and
                    companies powerful products to help turn
                    their work visions into a reality.
